description: How to create editorial cartoons that visually comment on issues from the press conference
---

Editorial Cartooning is a form of **visual opinion writing**.  
It uses art, symbolism, and satire to express commentary on issues raised in the press conference.

---

## 🎯 Goals of Editorial Cartooning  
- Provide a **visual interpretation** of the main issue.  
- Use **symbols and exaggeration** to simplify complex topics.  
- Encourage readers to **reflect or react** through humor, irony, or critique.

## ✍️ Elements of a Strong Cartoon  
- **Characters** → figures representing people or institutions (speaker, students, policies).  
- **Symbols** → objects or imagery that stand for ideas (cellphone = distraction, scale = justice).  
- **Exaggeration** → emphasize traits to highlight issues.  
- **Labels/Text** → short words or tags to clarify meaning.  
- **Satire/Humor** → add punch, but stay respectful and relevant.  

---

## 📝 Process of Creating  
1. **Identify the key issue** → main topic from the presscon.  
2. **Choose the angle** → support, critique, or highlight irony.  
3. **Draft sketches** → try different symbols and exaggerations.  
4. **Finalize the cartoon** → clear drawing with minimal but effective text.

## 🎥 Placement in Layout
