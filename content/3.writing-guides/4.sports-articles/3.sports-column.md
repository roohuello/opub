**Headline:** *Sports and studies: Striking the balance*  

The Tigers may have won the game, but the real battle lies in how schools manage the balance between sports and academics.  

Too often, athletes are celebrated for their victories while their struggles in the classroom are overlooked. Yesterday’s game proved how determination can shine on the court, but it also raised questions about what kind of support athletes receive beyond it.  

If schools truly value holistic education, they must ensure that sports training goes hand in hand with academic guidance. Winning on the court should not mean losing in the classroom.

**Headline:** *Isports at pag-aaral: Hanap ang balanse*  

Panalo nga ang Tigers sa laro, ngunit ang tunay na laban ay kung paano binabalanse ng mga paaralan ang sports at akademikong gawain.  

Madalas na mas pinupuri ang mga atleta dahil sa kanilang panalo ngunit nakakaligtaan ang kanilang hirap sa pag-aaral. Pinatunayan ng laro kahapon ang tatag ng loob sa court, ngunit nagbigay rin ito ng tanong: sapat ba ang suportang natatanggap ng mga atleta sa labas ng laro?  

Kung tunay na pinahahalagahan ng mga paaralan ang kabuuang edukasyon, dapat sabayan ng sports training ang wastong paggabay sa akademiko. Hindi dapat katumbas ng panalo sa court ang pagkatalo sa klase.
