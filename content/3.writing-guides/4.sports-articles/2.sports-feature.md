description: How to write a sports feature focusing on a character sketch of an MVP or key sports figure
---

The Sports Feature goes beyond scores and highlights—it tells the **story of a person behind the game**.  
It often focuses on an MVP, star athlete, coach, or even an inspiring team member, capturing their personality, struggles, and triumphs.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Highlight the **human side of sports** (values, determination, character).  
- Focus on **what makes the athlete/coach significant** beyond the game.  
- Tie the person’s journey to the recent sports event.  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Anecdotal/Descriptive Lead** — begin with a memorable scene or detail about the athlete.  
  - Example: *Sweat dripping and jersey soaked, James Cruz smiled after sinking the final basket—a shot that carried not just the Tigers, but also his years of hard work.*

---

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Anecdotal Lead** — open with a defining moment.  
2. **Background** — narrate personal or athletic journey.  
3. **Connection to Event** — show how the journey shaped the performance.  
4. **Character Traits** — highlight personality, values, or unique habits.  
5. **Ending/Kicker** — close with an inspiring quote or scene.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Humanize the hero** → show vulnerability as well as strength.  
- **Use anecdotes** → share locker room moments, training struggles, family support.  
- **Circle back** → end with the same person/scene from the lead for a strong finish.

**Headline:** *James Cruz: The calm finisher who carried the Tigers*  

Sweat dripping and jersey soaked, James Cruz smiled after sinking the final basket—a shot that carried not just the Tigers, but also his years of hard work.  

Long before he became the Tigers’ MVP, Cruz was the boy who stayed late in the gym, perfecting free throws while his classmates went home. Teammates say his dedication has always been unmatched.  

At yesterday’s semifinals, that dedication showed. Cruz scored 12 points in the last minutes, turning the game around for the Tigers.  

> “Every shot I took was for my team,” he said. “We’ve trained too hard to give up now.”  

For Cruz, the victory was not just about reaching the finals, but proving that persistence pays off.

**Headline:** *James Cruz: Ang kalmadong bayani ng Tigers*  

Basang-basa ng pawis at suot pa ang jersey, nakangiti si James Cruz matapos maipasok ang huling tira—isang basket na nagdala hindi lang sa Tigers, kundi pati sa mga taon ng kanyang pagsisikap.  

Bago pa man maging MVP ng Tigers, siya ang batang nananatili sa gym nang gabi-gabi, pinapakinis ang free throws habang nakauwi na ang iba. Ayon sa kanyang mga kakampi, kakaiba ang kanyang dedikasyon.  

Sa semifinals kahapon, lumutang ang dedikasyong iyon. Umiskor si Cruz ng 12 puntos sa huling minuto, dahilan ng pagbabalik at panalo ng Tigers.  

> “Bawat tira ko, para sa koponan,” aniya. “Sobra naming pinaghirapan kaya hindi kami susuko.”  

Para kay Cruz, higit pa sa finals ang panalo—patunay ito na may bunga ang tiyaga.
