- Highlight the **performance of players or teams**.  
- Emphasize what made the game significant (comeback, upset, record-breaking moment).  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Summary Lead** — begin with the game’s most important fact (who won and how).  
  - Example: *The Central High Tigers defeated the Westside Eagles, 72–68, in a nail-biting finish yesterday to advance to the division finals.*

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Summary Lead** — winner, score, event significance.  
2. **Game Flow** — describe how the game progressed (quarter by quarter, inning by inning).  
3. **Key Players** — highlight MVPs, standout plays, and turning points.  
4. **Quotes** — reactions from coaches or players.  
5. **Ending/Kicker** — mention next match or implication of the result.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Chronological play-by-play** → useful for dramatic matches.
