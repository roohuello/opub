**Headline:** *Maria Santos: Leading with calm resolve in the age of AI*  

With her calm but firm voice, Superintendent Maria Santos spoke of the need to safeguard education against AI misuse, a stance shaped by decades of service in classrooms.  

Before becoming Division Superintendent, Santos spent over 20 years teaching English. Colleagues describe her as disciplined yet compassionate, always looking out for her students’ growth.  

At yesterday’s press conference, she stressed that banning phones is not about restriction but about focus. *“This is not about banning phones,”* she said. *“It is about protecting real learning.”*  

Those who know her say the policy reflects her character: strict on rules, but always for the benefit of learners.

**Headline:** *Maria Santos: Namumuno nang may hinahon sa panahon ng AI*  

Sa kanyang mahinahon ngunit matatag na tinig, ipinahayag ni Superintendente Maria Santos ang pangangailangang protektahan ang edukasyon laban sa maling paggamit ng AI—isang pananaw na hinubog ng ilang dekada sa pagtuturo.  

Bago maging Superintendente ng Dibisyon, higit 20 taon siyang nagturo ng Ingles. Ayon sa kanyang mga kasamahan, siya’y disiplinado ngunit may malasakit, laging inuuna ang kapakanan ng mga mag-aaral.  

Sa press conference kahapon, iginiit niya na hindi simpleng pagbabawal ang polisiya. *“Hindi ito tungkol sa pagbabawal ng cellphone,”* aniya. *“Ito ay tungkol sa pagprotekta sa tunay na pagkatuto.”*  

Para sa mga nakakakilala sa kanya, ang polisiya ay repleksyon ng kanyang katauhan: mahigpit sa alituntunin ngunit laging nakatuon sa ikabubuti ng mga mag-aaral.
