description: How to write a human-interest story based on the press conference topic using the WSJ feature style
---

The Human-interest Feature puts the **spotlight on people’s stories** connected to the press conference topic.  
It uses the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) style: begin with a personal anecdote, move to the bigger issue, and return to the human story for impact.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Focus on **how the issue affects real people**.  
- Use **personal experiences or situations** to connect with readers emotionally.  
- Tie the human story to the press conference announcement.  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use
- **Anecdotal/Descriptive Lead** — start with a vivid personal story.  
  - Example: *Grade 10 student Carlo still hides his phone inside his bag during class, fearing it might distract him. With the Division’s new phone ban, he wonders if learning will finally feel different.*

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Anecdotal/Descriptive Lead** — tell a short personal story or set a scene.  
2. **Nut Graf** — explain the bigger issue (presscon topic) and why it matters.  
3. **Body** — mix of quotes, background info, and human perspectives.  
   - Add voices of affected people (students, teachers, parents).
   - Include context from the press conference.
4. **Ending/Kicker** — return to the human story or end with an emotional insight.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **WSJ-style structure** → anecdote → context → expansion → return.  
- **Humanize Data** → explain numbers through people’s lives.
- **Descriptive details** → sensory language (what was seen, heard, felt).

**Headline:** *For students like Carlo, phone ban feels personal*  

Grade 10 student Carlo still hides his phone inside his bag during class, fearing it might distract him. With the Division’s new phone ban, he wonders if learning will finally feel different.  

The Division Office announced stricter rules on phone use in classrooms during yesterday’s press conference, citing the growing misuse of AI apps and online distractions. Officials said the move aims to restore discipline and protect academic integrity.  

For Carlo, the change may bring relief. *“Sometimes I can’t resist checking notifications, even during lessons,”* he admitted. Teachers and parents echoed the concern, saying the policy could help rebuild focus.  

As the new rules roll out, Carlo hopes that classrooms will become a place where learning matters more than scrolling.

**Headline:** *Para kay Carlo, personal ang dating ng phone ban*  

Madalas pang itago ni Carlo, isang Grade 10 student, ang kanyang cellphone sa loob ng bag tuwing klase dahil takot siyang makaabala ito. Sa bagong phone ban ng Dibisyon, iniisip niya kung magiging iba na ang karanasan sa pag-aaral.  

Ipinahayag ng Tanggapan ng Dibisyon kahapon sa press conference ang mas mahigpit na pagbabawal ng cellphone, dahil sa dumaraming maling paggamit ng AI apps at online distractions. Layunin ng hakbang na ibalik ang disiplina at protektahan ang integridad ng pag-aaral.  

Para kay Carlo, maaari itong magdala ng ginhawa. *“Minsan hindi ko mapigilang silipin ang notifications kahit nasa klase,”* aniya. Sang-ayon din ang ilang guro at magulang, na sinabing makakatulong ang polisiya upang muling maibalik ang pokus.  

Habang ipinatutupad ang bagong patakaran, umaasa si Carlo na muling magiging lugar ng pagkatuto, at hindi ng pag-scroll, ang silid-aralan.
