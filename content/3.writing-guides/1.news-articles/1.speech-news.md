Speech News is the **main news article** when covering a press conference or speech.  
It reports the most important statements made by the speaker, giving readers a clear and factual account of the event.  

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Focus on the **key announcement or highlight** of the press conference.  
- Emphasize *what was said* and *why it matters*.

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Quotation Lead** works best — start with the strongest, most newsworthy quote from the speaker.  
  - Example: *“We will not allow AI misuse to compromise education,” declared Division Superintendent Maria Santos yesterday as the office announced stricter phone bans in classrooms.*  
- Use a **Summary Lead** if the quote is too long or weak.  
- Follow with a **nut graf** (context paragraph) that explains the significance of the announcement.

**Headline:** *“Hindi natin hahayaang sirain ng AI ang edukasyon” — Dibisyon*  

> “Hindi natin hahayaang sirain ng AI ang edukasyon,” mariing pahayag ni Superintendente Maria Santos kahapon sa press conference ng Dibisyon kung saan inanunsyo ang mas mahigpit na pagbabawal ng cellphone sa loob ng silid-aralan.  

Ayon kay Santos, layunin ng hakbang na mapanatili ang integridad ng pag-aaral matapos madiskubre ang pagdami ng mga estudyanteng umaasa sa AI apps para sa kanilang takdang-aralin at pagsusulit.  

Ipinaliwanag niya na bibigyan ng malinaw na gabay ang mga guro upang maisagawa nang patas ang polisiya at hinihikayat din ang mga magulang na makiisa.  

Dagdag pa ng Dibisyon, bahagi ito ng pambansang layunin na itaguyod ang responsableng paggamit ng teknolohiya sa edukasyon.  

> “Hindi ito simpleng pagbabawal ng cellphone,” giit ni Santos. “Ito ay tungkol sa pagprotekta sa tunay na pagkatuto.”
