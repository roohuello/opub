description: How to write an editorial expressing the official stance of the publication
---

An Editorial is the **official voice of the publication**.  
It presents the collective stance of the editorial board on an issue raised in the press conference. Unlike news, it is opinionated and persuasive.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Present a **clear position** on the issue from the press conference.  
- Speak in the **collective “we” voice** (representing the whole publication).  
- Focus on *why the issue matters* and *what should be done*.

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Stated Opinion Lead** — begin with a direct and strong position.  
  - Example: *The Division Office is right to strengthen the classroom phone ban. Academic integrity must come first in the age of AI.*

---

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Opinion Lead** — state the stand immediately.  
2. **Rationale** — explain why the stand is important (use context from the presscon).  
3. **Supporting Arguments** — cite facts, consequences, or values that back up the stance.  
4. **Counterpoint & Rebuttal** — acknowledge the opposing side briefly, then argue against it.  
5. **Conclusion/Kicker** — restate the stand with a call to action or memorable line.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Collective Voice** → use “we” instead of “I.”  
- **Persuasive Language** → strong, confident tone.  
- **Moral Appeal** → highlight responsibility, integrity, or public good.

**Headline:** *Why we support the classroom phone ban*  

The Division Office is right to strengthen the classroom phone ban. Academic integrity must come first in the age of AI.  

We have seen how phones have become distractions in class and tools for misuse of artificial intelligence. The press conference yesterday highlighted the urgency of this issue, reminding us that education must be safeguarded.  

Some may argue that phones are also used for research, but schools have other means to provide learning resources. The risks of cheating and dependency on AI outweigh the limited benefits of classroom phone use.  

We stand with the Division Office in ensuring authentic learning. It is time to reclaim the classroom as a space for discipline and true education.

**Headline:** *Bakit pabor kami sa pagbabawal ng cellphone sa klase*  

Tama ang hakbang ng Dibisyon na higpitan ang pagbabawal ng cellphone sa silid-aralan. Sa panahon ng AI, higit na dapat unahin ang integridad ng edukasyon.  

Nakita na natin kung paano nagiging sagabal ang cellphone sa klase at nagiging kasangkapan sa maling paggamit ng AI. Binanggit sa press conference kahapon ang bigat ng problemang ito, at nararapat lamang na tiyakin ang kalinisan ng pag-aaral.  

May ilan na maaaring mangatwiran na ginagamit din ang cellphone para sa pananaliksik, ngunit may iba pang paraan ang mga paaralan upang magbigay ng materyales. Mas mabigat ang panganib ng pandaraya at pag-asa sa AI kaysa sa limitadong benepisyo ng cellphone sa klase.  

Kaisa kami ng Dibisyon sa panawagang tiyakin ang tunay na pagkatuto. Panahon na upang ibalik ang silid-aralan bilang lugar ng disiplina at makabuluhang edukasyon.
