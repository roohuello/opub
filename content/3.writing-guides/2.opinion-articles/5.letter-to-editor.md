description: How to write a letter to the editor representing a mock reader’s reaction to an issue
---

A Letter to the Editor represents the **voice of a mock reader**.  
It is short, direct, and reacts to the issue raised in the press conference. Letters add diversity to the opinion page by showing how the public might respond.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- React as if you are a concerned reader (student, parent, teacher, or citizen).  
- Express agreement, concern, or suggestion about the issue.  
- Keep it **brief and impactful**.  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Direct Statement Lead** — start with the reaction immediately.  
  - Example: *Dear Editor, I support the Division’s decision to enforce the classroom phone ban because I believe it will help students focus more on learning.*

---

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Salutation** — usually “Dear Editor.”  
2. **Main Point** — state your reaction right away.  
3. **Supporting Reason** — explain briefly why you agree or disagree.  
4. **Closing Remark** — end with a short suggestion or reminder.  
5. **Signature/Name** — may use a mock identity (e.g., “A Concerned Parent”).  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Brevity** → keep it concise (150–200 words max).  
- **Authentic Voice** → write naturally, like a real reader.  
- **Role-based Perspective** → adopt the view of a student, parent, or teacher.

**Headline:** *Letter: Phone ban protects focus in classrooms*  

**Dear Editor,**  

I support the Division’s decision to strictly enforce the classroom phone ban. Every day, I see how mobile phones distract learners from lessons. Some even rely on AI apps to finish schoolwork instantly. This is not real learning.  

I believe this step will help students focus and bring back discipline in the classroom. I hope the policy is enforced fairly and supported by both teachers and parents.  

**Sincerely,**  
*A Concerned Teacher*

**Headline:** *Liham: Phone ban makakatulong sa pokus ng mga estudyante*  

**Mahal na Patnugot,**  

Sang-ayon ako sa hakbang ng Dibisyon na mahigpit na ipatupad ang pagbabawal ng cellphone sa klase. Araw-araw kong nakikita kung paano ito nakakaistorbo sa mga mag-aaral. May ilan pang gumagamit ng AI apps upang madaliin ang kanilang gawain. Hindi ito tunay na pagkatuto.  

Naniniwala ako na makakatulong ang patakarang ito upang muling ibalik ang pokus at disiplina sa silid-aralan. Nawa’y ipatupad ito nang patas at suportahan ng mga guro at magulang.  

**Lubos na gumagalang,**  
*Isang Alalahaning Guro*
