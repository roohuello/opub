**Puna ng Patnugot:**  

Nagbunsod ng sari-saring reaksyon mula sa mga guro, magulang, at estudyante ang anunsyo ng Dibisyon tungkol sa mas mahigpit na pagbabawal ng cellphone sa klase. May ilan na nakikitang mahalagang hakbang ito upang maprotektahan ang pagkatuto, habang ang iba nama’y nangangamba sa epekto nito sa digital access.  

Sa pahinang ito ng opinyon, tampok ang iba’t ibang tinig: ang aming editoryal na naglalahad ng opisyal na tindig ng publikasyon, mga kolumnistang nag-aalok ng personal at analitikal na pananaw, at mga mambabasang nagbahagi ng kanilang saloobin sa pamamagitan ng liham.  

Inaanyayahan namin kayong magbasa nang may bukas na isip at magnilay kung paano dapat hubugin ng teknolohiya ang kinabukasan ng edukasyon.
