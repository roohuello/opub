description: How to write a personal column presenting an individual writer’s perspective on an issue
---

A Personal Column reflects the **individual voice of a columnist**.  
It is opinionated, reflective, and often anecdotal. Unlike the editorial, which speaks for the whole publication, the column is written in the **first person (“I”)** or under a byline.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Share a **personal perspective** on the issue raised in the press conference.  
- May use anecdotes or experiences to illustrate the point.  
- Tone can be conversational, reflective, or even humorous.  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Anecdotal Lead** or **Reflective Lead** — start with a personal story, observation, or strong feeling.  
  - Example: *As a student, I have seen how mobile phones distract my classmates daily. That’s why the Division’s new phone ban makes sense to me.*

---

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Personal Lead** — anecdote, memory, or direct reflection.  
2. **Connection to Issue** — link personal experience to the press conference topic.  
3. **Main Argument** — explain why you agree or disagree.  
4. **Supporting Anecdotes/Observations** — strengthen the stance with relatable experiences.  
5. **Conclusion/Kicker** — end with a reflective or witty remark.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Conversational Tone** → write as if speaking directly to the reader.  
- **Imagery & Anecdotes** → make the piece lively and relatable.  
- **Punchy Ending** → close with a memorable line.

**Headline:** *Why I support the phone ban in classrooms*  

As a student, I have seen how mobile phones distract my classmates daily. Instead of listening to the teacher, many scroll through social media or use AI apps to finish their assignments.  

That is why I believe the Division Office’s decision to strengthen the classroom phone ban is timely and necessary.  

Phones are useful, yes, but only when used responsibly. In the classroom, they often do more harm than good. I have experienced moments when my own focus slipped because of constant notifications.  

This policy may be tough, but sometimes discipline is what we need to protect real learning.

**Headline:** *Bakit pabor ako sa phone ban sa klase*  

Bilang isang estudyante, madalas kong makita kung paano nakakaabala ang cellphone sa aking mga kaklase. Sa halip na makinig sa guro, marami ang abala sa social media o gumagamit ng AI apps para tapusin ang kanilang takdang-aralin.  

Kaya naniniwala ako na tama lamang ang hakbang ng Dibisyon na higpitan ang pagbabawal ng cellphone sa silid-aralan.  

Totoo, nakakatulong ang cellphone kung gagamitin nang tama. Ngunit sa klase, mas madalas itong nakakasama kaysa nakakatulong. Maging ako mismo ay naranasang mawalan ng pokus dahil sa walang tigil na notifications.  

Maaaring mahirap ang patakarang ito, pero minsan disiplina ang kailangan para mapanatili ang tunay na pagkatuto.
