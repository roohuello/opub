description: How to write response news that highlights audience, stakeholder, or community reactions from a press conference
--- 

Response News focuses on the **reactions of people** to the press conference announcement. 
It answers the question: *“How did others respond to what was said?”* and balances the main speech news by adding diverse voices.

---

## 🎯 Angle of the Article  
- Focus on **audience, stakeholders, or community responses** during or after the press conference.  
- Present multiple perspectives fairly (support, concern, suggestions).  

---

## ✍️ Lead to Use  
- **Reaction Lead** — begin with the strongest reaction or sentiment expressed.  
  - Example: *“Teachers welcomed the stricter classroom phone ban, while some students voiced concerns over its impact on learning,” were among the reactions during yesterday’s Division press conference.*

---

## 📝 Structure & Techniques  

1. **Reaction Lead** — highlight a mix of responses (positive/negative).  
2. **Attribution** — identify who made the statement (teacher, parent, student, official).  
3. **Supporting Quotes** — provide direct quotes showing reactions.  
4. **Paraphrased Transitions** — summarize views in between quotes to keep flow.  
5. **Ending/Kicker** — conclude with a strong reaction or a balanced note.  

**Techniques to strengthen writing:**  
- **Balance** → show multiple sides (not just agreement).  
- **Quote-Transition method** → avoid quote pile-up, maintain smooth flow.  
- **Human element** → reactions make the story relatable.

**Headline:** *Teachers support phone ban, students raise concerns*  

Teachers welcomed the Division Office’s move to enforce stricter phone bans in classrooms, while some students voiced concern about its impact on learning.  

> “This policy will help learners focus more on their studies and lessen distractions,” said teacher Liza Ramos after the announcement.  

Parents also expressed support, saying the rule would help discipline their children.  

However, several students feared the measure might affect their ability to access digital materials.  

> “Sometimes we use phones to search for lessons when the internet connection is unstable at school,” said Grade 10 student Carlo Dela Cruz.  

The Division assured that guidelines would include fair implementation and alternative learning support.

**Headline:** *Guro pabor sa phone ban, ilang estudyante nangangamba*  

Malugod na tinanggap ng mga guro ang desisyon ng Dibisyon na mas higpitan ang pagbabawal ng cellphone sa klase, ngunit ilang estudyante ang nagpahayag ng pangamba sa magiging epekto nito sa kanilang pag-aaral.  

> “Makakatulong ang polisiya para mas makapagpokus ang mga bata sa aralin at mabawasan ang sagabal,” wika ni Gng. Liza Ramos, isang guro, matapos ang anunsyo.  

Sang-ayon din ang ilang magulang, na sinabing makakatulong ang patakaran para sa disiplina ng kanilang mga anak.  

Gayunman, ilang estudyante ang nangangamba na makaapekto ito sa kanilang paggamit ng digital materials.  

> “Minsan ginagamit namin ang cellphone para maghanap ng leksyon kapag mahina ang internet sa paaralan,” sabi ni Carlo Dela Cruz, Grade 10 student.  

Tiniyak naman ng Dibisyon na may kasamang gabay para sa patas na pagpapatupad at suporta sa alternatibong pagkatuto.
