**Headline:** *4 in 10 learners lack internet access, Division cites in phone ban push*  

Four in ten learners in the division still lack reliable internet access, according to data revealed by the Division Office during a press conference yesterday.  

Superintendent Maria Santos said the statistics show how uneven access to technology has made students more dependent on mobile phones and AI tools.  

> “We cannot ignore the fact that many learners turn to shortcuts through AI apps because of poor access to guided digital resources,” Santos explained.  

The Division said this context supports the stricter classroom phone ban, noting that national policies also emphasize responsible digital use.  

Last year, a similar directive was released but was loosely enforced, prompting the office to strengthen the rule.

**Headline:** *4 sa 10 mag-aaral walang maaasahang internet, ayon sa Dibisyon sa pagpapatupad ng phone ban*  

Apat sa bawat sampung mag-aaral sa dibisyon ang walang maaasahang internet, ayon sa datos na inilabas ng Tanggapan ng Dibisyon sa isang press conference kahapon.  

Sinabi ni Superintendente Maria Santos na ipinapakita ng datos kung paano umaasa ang mga estudyante sa cellphone at AI apps dahil sa kakulangan ng pantay-pantay na access sa teknolohiya.  

> “Hindi natin maaaring balewalain na maraming mag-aaral ang kumakapit sa AI apps dahil kulang sila sa tamang digital resources,” paliwanag ni Santos.  

Ayon sa Dibisyon, ang kontekstong ito ang dahilan kung bakit mas paiigtingin ang pagbabawal ng cellphone sa klase, kasabay ng pambansang polisiya para sa responsableng paggamit ng teknolohiya.

Noong nakaraang taon, naglabas na ng kahalintulad na kautusan ngunit hindi mahigpit na naipatupad kaya’t ngayon ay pinalalakas muli ang alituntunin.
